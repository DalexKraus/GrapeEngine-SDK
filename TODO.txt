*** High Priority
Scene#registerNodeId needs to be called from the SceneSerializer to avoid ID duplicates!
Refactor packages to make more sense
Make NewNodeDialog singleton

*** Medium Priority
- Update node tree according to which scene is opened

*** Low Priority
- Ctrl + mouse wheel scales grid size
- Grid size changes only in the newest viewport (Is this really a bug?)
